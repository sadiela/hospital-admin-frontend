# Admin Front End for Hospital App

This repository contains React code for a frontend for the admin module of the [hospital app](https://github.com/sadiela/hospital-app).

### Deliverables:
1. **SSO with Google**: Only users whose emails are in the admin list should be able to access this application. 
2. **Add Users to System**: Insert a new user into the user database.
3. **View Users**: See full list of users with contact information and roles. 
4. **Delete Users**: Delete a user from the database.
5. **Add Device**: Add a new device into the device database.
6. **View Devices**: View list of devices
7. **Assign Patient to Doctor**: Assign a patient to a doctor.
8. **Assign Devices to Patients**: Link a device from the device database to a particular patient.

### Tests
1. Sign on:
    1. With a valid admin email address
    2. As anyone besides an admin
2. Add a user
3. View users
4. Delete a user
5. View devices 
6. Add devices
7. View list of patients for a doctor
8. Assign devices to users
9. Assign doctors to patients

You can find a video demo where I test all of the above functionality [here](https://youtu.be/lkPSuwJ-LdM). (Sorry for low audio quality).

### Things to Add/Improve
1. CSS to make the UI look cleaner
2. Ensure no device overlaps
3. Deal properly with deleting devices and users
